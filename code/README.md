# DVGrabber device code

Here is the very WIP code for the DVGrabber. Currently this is just dvgrabber.py, a blockout for the OLED display interface for v3 (which is a long ways off).

dvgrabber.py pre-requisites:

 - Linux, Sorry cant test on windows at the moment. Its a console Text User Interface (TUI) program and the Pi CM4 will be running linux, so its currently tailored for that.
 - python 3.7 or higher
 - PicoTUI library
```pip install picotui```
